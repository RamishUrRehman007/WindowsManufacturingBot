Window Manufacturing Chatbot is a web-based application designed to assist users with questions related to window manufacturing. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) via OpenAI, the chatbot provides detailed and accurate information about different types of windows, manufacturing processes, installation, maintenance, and more. The application ensures a smooth conversational context to handle follow-up questions effectively.

## üèõ Architecture

- **Redis Queue and Pub/Sub**: Used for managing tasks and message brokering.
- **Sockets**: For real-time communication between the client and server.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application for easy deployment.
- **LangChain**: Manages conversational context and dialogue flow.
- **OpenAI LLM**: Provides the intelligence behind the chatbot‚Äôs responses.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Navigate to the project directory and use Docker Compose to start the application:

1. **Build the Deployment Docker Image**:
   
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d postgres
    ```
    
2. **Run migration.sh and Create Tables Inside DB Container**:
   
    ```
    docker-compose exec postgres sh -c '/mnt/migration.sh -d window_manufacturing_bot'
    ```
    - **Note**: You only need to do this once unless there are some changes in our DB schemas.
    - If you encounter a permission error, run the following command:
        ```
        docker-compose exec postgres sh -c 'chmod 777 mnt/migration.sh'
        ```
    
3. **Build and Up All Containers**:

    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```
    - Now, review the resources you are about to create, update, or delete to ensure they are what you expect
